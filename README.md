# ML-case-studies-with-tree-based-models-in-Python
In this repository, I have covered how to use Python to train decision trees and tree-based models. We are using Automobile dataset and breastcancer dataset here. In Automobile dataset, we need Predict Miles per gallon of the engine. Predictor attribute is continous here. In breastcancer dataset, need to classify whether patient has breastcancer or not. With the Jupyter notebook files, we will understand the advantages and shortcomings of trees and demonstrate how ensembling can alleviate these shortcomings, all while practicing on real-world datasets. Finally, we will also understand how to tune the most influential hyperparameters in order to get the most out of your models.
